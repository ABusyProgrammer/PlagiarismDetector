# Overview
The program is expected to take in 2 text files, and look for similarities between the 2 of them. The present goal of this project is to detect the degree of absolute matching between the 2 text files.

# Development Environment
**Java** will serve as the primary language for development. THis is not a web-based application, and its user interface will run through the console, or through command-line arguments.

IntelliJ IDEA was the integrated development environment used for developing this program.
